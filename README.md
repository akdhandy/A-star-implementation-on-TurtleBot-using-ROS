Implementation of A* Algorithm for rigid robot in an obstacle workspace

DESCRIPTION - The python program  to perform A* algorithm for a rigid robot based on user's input.
The algorithms are run in an obstacle filled environment composed of a rectangle, circle, ellipse,rhombus and a polygon. The algorithm finds the shortest path to goal node from the start node(both user provided) and displays the explored nodes and the path.

	Upon the running the code the user is prompted to provide a number of inputs. The sample usecase has been provided below -

	Please enter radius of the robot: -->
  
	1(**then press Enter)
	**** for rigid robot enter a non zero radius****
	
	Please enter the clearance:-->
	1(**then press Enter)
	
	Please enter start point x coordinate -->
	5(**press Enter)

	Please enter start point y coordinate -->
	5(**press Enter)
	
	Please enter goal point x coordinate -->
	295(**press Enter)
	
	Please enter goal point y coordinate -->
	195(**press Enter)
